# The Vision
Our team seeks to create an app to coordinate cleaning assignments and schedules for Calvin Cleaning Crew employees and supervisors. The current system uses paper housekeeping logs and contact lists, which waste paper and are innefficient and error-prone communication tools between employees and supervisors. Our app will remedy this by providing instant access to an updated list of cleaning assignments, employee information, and time-off requests.
# The Details
Upon opening the app, employees can log in and see, in a simple bulleted list, all their cleaning assignments by room numbers, and check them off as they're completed. Employees and supervisors should both be able to leave comments attached to rooms that are visible between other employees and supervisors alike. Employees should be able to easily and straightforwardly request time off to their supervisor.
When a supervisor opens the app, they see a list of rooms that need cleaning, as well as a list of their available employees. From there, they can delegate cleaning assignments to their employees, write and view comments, and check if cleaning has been done. When a time off request is made by an employee, supervisors can either approve, revise, or decline the request.
Eventually, we would like to include the directory of buildings and rooms visibly on a searchable map of campus. Users could also have the ability to leave photos in room comments, and link their schedules to an interactive calendar.
# Non-Technical Requirements
In addition to what the app does, there are also some limitations and requirements regarding <i>how</i> the app operates. The app must be built for Android and must run on any smartphone released in the last five years. The app should be intuitive, easy to use, and fool-proof—users should be able to figure out how to use the entire thing in 5 minutes or less, and errors should be handled without crashing. Several users, and a combination of supervisors and employees, should be able to use the app at the same time. Most importantly, the app should be fast—communicating with the server shouldn't take more than 5 seconds.
# Where We Are & Where We're Headed
Our current prototype (at the end of Sprint 2) implements the checklist landing page. There is a checklist organized by a room subheading. For now this checklist is hardcoded—once we connect our app to a database, the checklist will display a user's unique cleaning assignments. The menu on top navigates to a seperate About page with an unrevised version of our vision statement and our team members' names.
We have a few things in mind for our next steps. The first is to create a login page that is presented upon opening the app. This way, employee users can access their unique cleaning assignments. Another is to create a different landing page if a user logs in with supervisors credentials. Supervisors should then be able to delegate cleaning that still needs to be done. Before we learn how to connect all this to a database of cleaned and uncleaned rooms, as well as a database of available employees, all values will need to be hardcoded.
