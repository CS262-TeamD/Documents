# The Vision
<b>The Cleaning Crew App is about hightening ease of use and eliminating waste, of material as well as time.</b>
Our team seeks to establish a mobile-friendly user database for the Building Services Office and Campus Properties, eliminating the need for paper housekeeping logs and contact lists while providing instant access to information such as time-off requests and a connection to needed information for both student workers and supervisors.
# The Details
Upon opening the app, employees can log in and see, in a simple bulleted list, all their cleaning assignments by room numbers, and check them off as they're completed. Employees and supervisors should both be able to leave comments attached to rooms that are visible between other employees and supervisors alike. Employees should be able to easily and straightforwardly request time off to their supervisor.
When a supervisor opens the app, they see a list of rooms that need cleaning, as well as a list of their available employees. From there, they can delegate cleaning assignments to their employees, write and view comments, and check if cleaning has been done. When a time off request is made by an employee, supervisors can either approve, revise, or decline the request.
Eventually, we would like to include the directory of buildings and rooms visibly on a searchable map of campus. Users could also have the ability to leave photos in room comments, and link their schedules to an interactive calendar.
